## WebGL ##

On December 22 2010, the latest [WebGL specification](https://cvs.khronos.org/svn/repos/registry/trunk/public/webgl/doc/spec/WebGL-spec.html) was released--derived from OpenGL ES 2.0 and uses HTML5 canvases.  This technology has been revolutionizing the web, and due to current limitations it will continue to revolutionize it for a long time.

### PyCUDA ###

[pycyda](http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda) is a CUDA (C on NVIDIA GPUs) that could easily be used from a Django server with the appropriate video configuration.  While I don't suppose this is exactly tied into HTML5, it could be used to support fast processing of more complicated computations.
