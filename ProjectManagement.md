# Project Management #

Presently classcomm is using GoogleCode for project portal, Wiki Documents, and Subversion Repository.  We now additionally have JIRA for Agile Project Management, and we will be publishing big picture Road Map here in the Wiki Doc RoadMap.

Classcomm project management now follows the principles of Agile Development using Atlassian Jira with the GreenHopper Plugin deployed to a server in Germany.  We thank [Atlassian](http://www.atlassian.com/) for providing us with free Open Source licenses.
